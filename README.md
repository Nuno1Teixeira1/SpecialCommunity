# Introduction
The third and last group project related with @<Academia de Código_> #68 Bootcamp @ Porto... The Hackathon. We had to develop a website based on a random "TV Series" theme, and we got... [Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHbiHcrA18w&ab_channel=The88-Topic). So our idea of a website related with that TV series, was to focus on study groups. 

# Special Community
A website aimed to help students with their projects/ ideas/ work, by matching with others of the same area/course or with similiar subjects in order to form a study group, so together they can reach higher goals.
